# IBD

In this repository, I'm working on solving Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD).
I know - very modest...
I do realize that the problem is very complex and requires several breakthroughs in immunology, microbiology, drug design, diagnostics, and probably many other fields.
But I still can't wrap my head around the fact that currently patients are treated with a trial-and-error approach, and that there is no way to predict whether a patient will respond to a given therapy.
That's why, we'll start with this problem.
**The result should be a diagnostic test used by clinicians to assign patients to the right therapy.**

I've found an absolute ****load of data just lying around the Internet.
They're all from different studies, different labs, different countries, different years, different technologies, different everything, so it should be fun to try to make sense of it all.
But so far, I've identified nearly 1200 (sic!) samples of expression data from mucosal biopsies of IBD patients.
Some of them with response information so I think it's reeeeally worth a shot!
