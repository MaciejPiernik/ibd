# IBD

In this repository, I'm working on solving Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD).
I know - very modest...
I do realize that the problem is very complex and requires several breakthroughs in immunology, microbiology, drug design, diagnostics, and probably many other fields.
But I still can't wrap my head around the fact that currently patients are treated with a trial-and-error approach, and that there is no way to predict whether a patient will respond to a given therapy.
That's why, we'll start with this problem.
**The result should be a diagnostic test used by clinicians to assign patients to the right therapy.**
